# 🔗 Link Flow – Bluetooth Data Sharing via React

Link Flow is a simple, responsive React web app that allows users to enter their details, and securely share this data over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) using the Web Bluetooth API. It’s perfect for experimenting with BLE modules or apps like **nRF Connect** if you do not have access to BLE devices.
